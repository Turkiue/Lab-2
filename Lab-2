   <h1>The Early History of Motion Pictures</h1> 
   <h2>The First years of the media</h2>
   <p><strong>Since motion pictures were invented, audiences have loved how they tell stories.</strong> Movies enabled people to travel the world vicariously,
     and experience tragedy, love and nearly every other emotion. Movies spread quickly, making them one of the most accessible and beloved forms of entertainment in the world.</p>
     <h3>Setting Photography in Motion</h3>
     <p>Photography became a part of public life in the mid-19th century, <b>especially during the Civil War,</b> when photographers documented American battlefields for the first time. Experimenting with ways to exhibit photographs,
         several inventors came up with a simple toy that made it possible for a series of pictures to be viewed in rapid succession,
          creating the illusion of motion. It was called a zoetrope.</p>
          <h4>A New Art Form</h4>
          <p>While the first films were of commonplace occurrences — trains approaching, people dancing, and animals playing — filmmakers soon started to incorporate story lines and music into their works. Between the years of 1890 and 1927,
             thousands of silent films were produced, with an ever increasing sophistication of story line and technical craftsmanship.</p>
